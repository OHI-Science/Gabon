Gabon
==========

Data file from Johanna to see how LSP/SP scores would improve with addition of additional protected areas.

Final notes (emailed on 3/18/2015)

The addition of the 2015 protected areas results in the Lasting Special Places subgoal increasing from 77 to 100.  Because Lasting Special Places is a component of the Sense of Place goal, this goal's score increased from 71 to 83.  And the overall country score for Gabon when from 54 to 56.

The spatial data provided by Johanna was somewhat different from the spatial data we used for the global analysis (beyond the addition of the 2015 protected area data). Consequently, the 2014 scores reported on the OHI website for Gabon are a bit different (OHI 2014 data: LSP score: 86; SP score: 76; Gabon: 55).

I have attached the following: 
 - summarized score data (GabonSummary.xlsx)
 - protected area data of Gabon extracted for the 1 km inland and 3 nm offshore regions (gabon mpa.xlsx)
